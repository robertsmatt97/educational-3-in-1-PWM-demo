Fall 2019 Power Electronics: Modern Topics Semester Project (with Houshang Salimian Rizi)   
EE 394 Semester Project, assigned by Dr. Alex Hanson   

## Description
The 3-in-1 PWM Converter is used as a visual aid for students to learn about designing basic PWM converters, including the Buck, Boost, and Buck-Boost topologies.   
The converter was designed using KiCAD, with the specifications located in `Project_1.pdf`.   
Instructions on how to use the converter, as well as design choices and improvements, can be found in `User_Manual.pdf`.
